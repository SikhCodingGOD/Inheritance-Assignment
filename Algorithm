Purpose of Code --> To calculate the volume and surface area of 3D shapes given certain shapes with specific measurements

Algorithm (Basic design)
- Create a class for all 3D shapes
    - parameters for length, width and height
- Create subclasses for:
    - prisms
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - pyramids
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - spheres
        - input for length, width, height is not needed
        - need input for radius
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - tori
        - input for length, width, height is not needed
        - need input for inner and outer radius
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - cylinders
        - input for length, width is not needed
        - need input for radius
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - cones
        - input for length, width is not needed
        - need input for radius
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
    - cubes
        - need calculations for volume, surface area
        - only one of length, width or height is needed because all three values are equal
