Pseudocode for the methods within each class:

Prism:
- calculate volume
  - get user input for length, width and height
  - all values must be positive
  - length x width x height = volume
- calculate surface area
  - get user input for length, width, height
  - all  values must be positive
  - 2 x (width x length + height x length + height x width) = surface area
- display answers (all subclasses inherit this method)
  - print out a statement to the user which includes the values for volume and surface area
 
Square Pyramid (subclass of Prism):
- calculate volume (override superclass)
  - get user input for side length and height
  - all values must be positive
  - side^2 x height / 3 = volume
- calculate surface area (override superclass)
  - get user input for side length and height
  - all values must be positive
  - side^2 + 2 x side x Square root of (side^2 / 4 + height^2) = surface area
  
Sphere (subclass of Prism):
- calculate volume (override superclass)
  - get user input for radius
  - value must be positive
  - 4 x pi x radius^3 /3 = volume
- calculate surface area (override superclass)
  - get user input for radius
  - value must be positive
  - 4 x pi x radius^2 = surface area
  
Cylinder (subclass of Prism):
- calculate volume (override superclass)
  - get user input for radius and height
  - all values must be positive
  - pi x radius^2 x height = volume
- calculate surface area (override superclass)
  - get user input for radius and height
  - all values must be positive
  - 2 x pi x radius x height + 2 x pi x radius^2
  
  Main method:
  - get user input for what shape to enter values for (use switch statement)
    - 1 - Prism class
    - 2 - Square Pyramid class
    - 3 - Sphere Class
    - 4 - Cylinder Class
  - have the user input values depending on what shape they are trying to calculate the volume and surface area for
  - call the 'display answers' method to output the volume and surface area of the shape to the user
